The annual budgeting season is truly a ritual of fiction.

Every year, we play the same budgeting game. It typically starts one of two ways: either we endure the 'bottom-up' charade, where department heads sandbag their inputs only to have them overridden by aggressive corporate targets, or we suffer the 'top-down' decree, where the C-suite simply hands down a number. The path doesn't matter because the destination is the same: an arbitrary EBITDA target that operational teams don't believe in and didn't really sign up for. And these figures are pitched to the board as concrete commitments, yet they remain arbitrary numbers divorced from operational reality.

Rarely do leaders discuss how they'll be achieving these targets, largely because the process prioritizes financial predictability over strategic depth. While intended to ensure fiscal discipline, the exercise has morphed into a performative action designed to signal ambition rather than chart a viable path for growth. A finance team will spend months cementing these figures into a static spreadsheet, yet by the time the ink is dry, everything has changed. The budget becomes a "window to the past" rather than a navigational tool for the future.

We are simply moving numbers around without meaning. We create targets that offer false certainty while distracting us from real growth opportunities.

While this was once acceptable business practice, it persists as a pervasive, outdated anchor in our industry, particularly in Brick & Mortar (B&M) casinos. If we are to thrive against an expanding online space, we must dismantle the illusion that we can predict the future through a linear, annual spreadsheet. We must adopt a dynamic operating model—one that allows for mistakes, experiments, and the opportunity to find real growth.

## The Culture of Rigid Budgeting

Despite the unique nature of B&M casinos, the industry remains inexplicably fixated on the "Annual Budget" and managing to a rigid number. This trannsforms into a culture of forensic "variance analysis." We scramble to explain why we missed the number, ignoring that the 'how'—the strategic roadmap to achieve it—was missing from day one.

We compound this error by constantly comparing daily results to like-days from the previous year. Every operator knows the pain of that random Tuesday morning email, agonizing over how to explain why slots were down 4% on a rainy day compared to a sunny day last year. Was it the weather? A promotion? A late mail piece?

We search for operational failures in data that is often just random variation. These windows of variance are effectively noise, yet we treat them as signals, distracting us from the bigger trends occurring in our business.

We become so narrow in our view that we inadvertently create nothing but "discovery killers" in our strategic frameworks. We constantly prioritize optimizing extraction over optimizing engagement. We are terrified of building real, meaningful value.

## The Objective Paradox: You Can’t Plan Greatness

I recently read a fascinating book called *Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned* (Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman). It articulates a counter-intuitive concept that explains why the rigid casino budgeting process often backfires: **The Objective Paradox**.

The core argument is that aiming directly at ambitious, complex goals is often the best way to ensure you don't reach them. When applied to our industry, the implications are profound. If we fixate entirely on a specific EBITDA number—the "Objective"—we inadvertently filter out any initiative that doesn't have a guaranteed, linear path to that number. We stop exploring the interesting, slightly risky ideas that might actually lead to the next breakthrough. By rigorously optimizing for the budget, we optimize away the experimentation necessary to find the future.

Consider the post-pandemic revenue surge of 2021–2023. Executives across the industry celebrated these record highs as strategic wins, yet how many of today's budgets remain dangerously anchored to these anomalous years?

Then there is the relentless demand for immediate ROI. Set the budget aside for a moment and consider the last capital project tied to genuine growth, not just maintenance. How many transformative ideas never reached the board because we demanded too much certainty too soon? By enforcing strict ROI metrics on innovation, we kill the stepping stones necessary to find the future.

## From Outcomes to Behavior

We prioritize the destination over the journey. As an industry, we are obsessed with outcomes ("Did we hit the number?"), yet meta-analyses on performance show that process ("Did we execute the behavior?") has a significantly larger effect on success.

To harness this effect, leaders must shift their scrutiny from the result to the behavior. Instead of asking, "Why was revenue down yesterday?" we should ask, "Did we execute the three A/B tests we planned, and how do those results look?"

By focusing on the execution of experiments rather than the immediate financial outcome, we not only reduce the fear of judgment that paralyzes innovation, but we also uncover the stepping stones for success.

Ultimately, we must choose between the comfort of the known and the potential of the unknown. The legacy model of the casino industry relies on the False Certainty of historical data. We comfort ourselves with long spreadsheets and precise targets, but these are often numbers without meaning—projections based on the past, negotiated through sandbagging, and executed through fear.

Real growth comes from agility. It comes from "good mistakes" that provide data. By moving to rolling forecasts and tiny, iterative experiments, we lower our risk profile while increasing our learning rate. We stop trying to predict the future of the casino floor, and instead, build a system that allows us to discover it.
